// What the dish is doing right now, derived from the sample buffer in one place.
//
// Every span here is cut from wall-clock now rather than from a count of
// trailing samples, because a dish that stops answering stops appending: a span
// counted in readings stands still with the data and goes on presenting the
// last healthy minute as the current one.
//
// `nowMs` comes back out with the readings because the chart windows are cut
// against the same instant. Two clocks read a beat apart would let a figure and
// the chart beneath it describe fractionally different moments.
